## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Maven
- Spring Boot

This project I could not properly deploy it. I have spent the past week trying but to no avail and there is always an 500 error which I cannot fix. I please request for an extension to better understand why this was the case. There is always errors on my computer and I cannot sort out the local host either. Even reformatting the naming for the files and variables cause problems.

please check the amount of commits I have made throughout this assignment. I want to know if my system is wrong or was I the issue.
